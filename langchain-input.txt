Client Testimonials"Engagebay works pretty well with my business. I was using ActiveCampaign but the costs were adding up quite quickly. I tried other platforms but the automation sequence offered by ActiveCampaign is not easy to find, until, I got Engagebay. The platforms offer an awesome automation platform for emails, plus landing pages and forms. It works quite well and can be a perfect substitute."Leonardo W.Founder, Wolff Consultoria"The software is easy to set up and implement. I feel EngageBay is quickly becoming a marketing automation competitor to the premium SAAS offerings. EngageBay's customer support has been very responsive and helped me resolve an implementation issue almost immediately."Shawn L.Marketing Manager, List Biological Laboratories, Inc"A full-featured marketing platform. With this, you have all you need to get started and succeed.
